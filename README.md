# Problem Solving
A toolkit to solve problems with programming, consisting of data structures, algorithms and problem archives.

My solutions for coding problems from various sources such as Kattis, internship tests etc..

## Introduction
This repository is used to keep track of all the data structures, algorithms and problem archives I have learnt and experienced to allow a quick revision. I am doing my best to include as much context as possible so that you know how these materials have been used and how it could be useful for you.

## Usage
* String
* Array

* Recursion
* Memoization
* Sorting
    * Insertion sort
    * Bubble sort
    * Merge sort
    * Quick sort
    * Selection sort
* Traversal
    * Depth-first search
    * Breadth-first search
* Search
    * Binary search

* Hash map
* Linked list
    * Singly-linked list
    * Doubly-linked list []
* Queue
    * Queue
    * Deque
* Stack
    * Stack
* Heap
    * Heap
    * Priority queue (heap w/ custom priority functions)

* Graph
    * SSSP
        * Is the graph a tree? DFS/BFS
        * Is the graph unweighted? BFS
        * Is the graph a DAG? one-pass Bellman Ford/DFS
        * Does the graph have only non-negative edges? (modified / original Dijkstra)
        * Does the graph have no negative cycles? (modified Dijkstra)
        * If all else fails (standard Bellman Ford)
* Tree
    * Minimal spanning tree
        * Prim
        * Kruskal
    * Binary search tree []
    * AVL tree
